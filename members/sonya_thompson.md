      <p>I was raised in Arizona and came from a blended family of 5 kids! I had so many interests growing up from performing arts, animals, weather, and fashion, it was challenging to pin down a direction. As an ambitious entrepreneur, I found a natural, creative side of myself in Cosmetology, and earned my license at 19. After assisting at the Elizabeth Arden Salon and managing a five-star hotel salon, I opened my own Salon Studio at the age of 21. I have always enjoyed working directly with people and hearing first hand, their story. In 1999, my small family of 4, and baby on the way, moved to Las Vegas.  It was a unique opportunity to explore something completely new. Relocating my family was one of the most rewarding and unexpected experiences I’d ever had.  I threw myself into finding out about the city, schools, parks, programs for my children, and connecting with the community. It was an amazing new beginning and adventure.  I realized how much I enjoyed meeting new people, acquiring knowledge of the area, and finding my next home for my family!</p>
      <p>My talent for Real Estate had started way back with my parents both licensed agents.  I acquired my Real Estate license in 2003 and had the privilege of working with my mother for the first two years in the industry. In 2005, I joined Keller Williams Realty Las Vegas, divorced in 2007, and moved to Keller Williams Realty Southwest in 2012.  I am one of the top producers for the office market center, and have served on the Agent Leadership Council. I’m past president of LeTip of Summerlin 2012-14.</p>
      <p>Personal development is essential for growth. In 2015, I graduated PSI VII; Life Success Course, PSI Women’s Leadership Course, and a proud recent Graduate of Leadership Henderson Class 2016!  Involvement in our community & volunteering is part of who I am. I support The American Cancer Society, & served as a facilitator for their Look Good Feel Better Program.  I volunteer with Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth & Three Square.</p>
      <p>From 1999-2012, I raised my three children in Summerlin. In 2014, I moved to Henderson and married my husband Gary!  I am a newlywed, have one dog, enjoy gardening, hiking, golf, food & wine, and travel!</p>
      <p>I am passionate about helping my clients meet their goals in Real Estate whether they are buying or selling. I’ve acquired multiple designations which support the variety of transactions in single family homes, short sales, foreclosures, second homes, luxury lifestyles, and investment portfolios.  I have an opportunity to work with a variety of people every day.  Through my practice in Real Estate, I help clients achieve their goals. As a community resource and real estate expert, my career is full of rewards, and building new relationships!  I love what I do and it shows!</p>
