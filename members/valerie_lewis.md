      <p>I have been a licensed Life and Health Insurance Agent since 2010. I am originally from Central Pennsylvania and left home at the ripe old age of 17 to study Fashion in Long Beach, CA.</p>
      <p>I have a degree in Fashion Design, but left the industry in 1993 when my husband and I relocated to Las Vegas, NV where we currently reside with our daughter.</p>
      <p>People need better options in today's challenging economy to financially recover from unexpected illnesses or accidents. Therefore, I educate companies, their employees, and individuals regarding supplemental plans that pay a direct cash benefit in the unfortunate event of a sickness or injury. I offer affordable and customizable voluntary policies as an independent Aflac Agent.</p>
