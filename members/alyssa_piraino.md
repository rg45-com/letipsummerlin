      <p>Alyssa was born and raised in Norman, Oklahoma. After earning a Bachelor of Science in Gaming Management from UNLV, Alyssa moved to San Diego and then back to Norman, working in the casino industry. After several fun, but unfulfilling years in the gaming industry, Alyssa knew that she needed to switch gears and find a career that would allow her to help others, challenge herself, and allow her to put her love of writing to good use. After much thought, Alyssa knew that it was time to accept her destiny and follow in the footsteps of her father and brother, to become an attorney.</p>

      <p>In 2014, Alyssa and her husband returned to Las Vegas so she could attend the Boyd School of Law at UNLV. While at Boyd, Alyssa served on the boards of the Gaming Law Society and the Native American Law Student Association and became an Editor for the UNLV Gaming Law Journal. In 2017, Alyssa graduated from Boyd, receiving the Dean's Award of Excellence.</p>

      <p>By her second year of law school, Alyssa knew that she wanted to work in personal injury law because she wanted to help injured people in the Las Vegas community. She applied to Henness and Haight because of the firm’s reputation for doing just that. During her clerkship, Alyssa gained priceless practical knowledge and had the opportunity to sharpen her litigation skills. Notably, she had the invaluable opportunity to work closely with Henness and Haight’s trial team leading up to and during a wrongful death jury trial brought against an international trucking company. This experience confirmed her decision that Henness and Haight was the right fit for her post-graduation, as her colleagues were not afraid to fight for what was right, even if that meant taking on a corporate giant.</p>

      <p>Alyssa takes great pride in providing superior representation through individualized attention to each injured client. Through personal experiences, Alyssa knows how overwhelming the “what now?” can be in the aftermath of an injury, which makes her even more committed to empowering injured clients and allowing them to focus on what matters most—their health.</p>

      <p>In her free time, Alyssa enjoys spending time with her husband and their fur babies. She also enjoys traveling with family and friends, going to concerts, and watching sports—Boomer Sooner and Thunder Up!</p>
