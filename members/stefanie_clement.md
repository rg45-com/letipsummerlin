      <p>I am a graduate of the University of New Mexico with a B.A. in History and Political Science.  Given my degrees it is not a surprise that I went to law school and when I attended college that was my goal.  I worked for a small law firm for two years in college and upon graduation I moved to Maryland with my husband.   I worked for another small firm doing estate planning and real estate work for two years prior to attending the George Washington University Law School.   I'm definitely the exception to the rule, as I really enjoyed the rigors of law school.</p>
    	<p>During my third year of law school, after 5 years in Maryland, it was clear we were not meant to live on the East Coast.  We packed our bags and moved to Las Vegas in 1997, where we have remained.  I sat for the Bar exam in July 1997 and passed and was admitted to practice here in the fall of 1997.</p>
    	<p>I worked for a law firm of 6-8 lawyers for nearly two years practicing estate planning, probate, guardianship, civil litigation and some bankruptcy work representing creditors.  I learned a great deal working with those attorneys but determined it was time to branch out on my own.</p>
    	<p>In August 2000, I created Stefanie H. Clement, P.C. which is now known as Clement Law Offices.  I have practiced in the areas of personal injury, insurance defense work, family law, civil litigation, consumer bankruptcy, estate planning, probate and guardianship.  After several years I was able to trim my practice down to the areas where I am best suited to use my skills and that I really enjoy and today Clement Law Offices is limited to Estate Planning, Probate, Guardianship, consumer Bankruptcy and some minor traffic violations.</p> 
    	<p>I am a member of the State Bar of Nevada, National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys and was a founding member of the Nevada Guardianship Association.  I enjoy working with individual clients one-on-one and look at myself as an attorney and counselor to my clients regarding financial, family and other issues they may be facing.</p>
    	<p>I am also the mother to two wonderful sons who keep me quite busy.  I am President of the PTO at their elementary school and Secretary of Lone Mountain Little League where my boys play ball all fall and spring.</p>
